# Description

This repository contains tests for the frontend of the [Relational API](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/101022) project. The frontend has a separate codebase [here](https://github.com/tomashauser/relational-converter-frontend). These tests are written in Selenium using a [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) ideology.

# SUT
![Website screenshot](images/WebsiteScreenshot.PNG?raw=true "Title")

The purpose of the application is to convert between two notations that are used to write queries in a formal query language called <strong>R</strong>elational <strong>A</strong>lgebra (RA). Furthermore, the application can take any valid RA query and convert it into another formal query language called <strong>T</strong>uple <strong>R</strong>elational <strong>C</strong>alculus (TRC).

# Testing Framework

Selenium, Serenity BDD and JUnit5 were chosen. The plugin is set up in such a way that the command `mvn clean verify` generates a report in the target folder.

# Testing strategy

My goal was to verify the correctness of every functionality depicted in the use case diagram. After all, the diagram shows every possible action user can take in the application.

Each use case was unit tested and some had additional coverage which is discussed in the following sections

## Path based tests
For the path based tests there were only two sensible possibilities - notation conversion process and the conversion from RA into TRC. Since the application is pretty much linear, there is no branching and the diagrams are rather simple and quite literally straight forward.

The following diagram shows a conversion from the activity diagram into a correspondign decision graph with the generated TDLs on the right.

A decision graph for the conversion into TRC was made in a similar fashion.

Tests for both diagrams are located in `src/test/java/tests/integration/pathbased`.

# Combination data

Combinatorial data were generated for the notation conversion process. The following table shows the possible combinations.

| Notation              | Schema              | Semantic Checking  | Formatting         |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Standard / Simplified | Correct / Incorrect | Enabled / Disabled | Enabled / Disabled |

Mixed strength, pairwise and threeway combinations were generated by the ATCS software. For example, the pairwise:

> STANDARD,CORRECT,false,false

> SIMPLIFIED,CORRECT,true,true

> STANDARD,INCORRECT,true,false

> SIMPLIFIED,INCORRECT,false,true

> STANDARD,EMPTY,true,true

> SIMPLIFIED,EMPTY,false,false


# Equivalence classes

As the application does not have any clear input field for which a discussion about equivalence classes would be feasible, an input regular expression for the relation declarations in the input schema panel was used.

Let *IdentifierRegex := [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]\**. The regex used for table declarations is then defined by 

*^|(^${identifierRegex}\\(${identifierRegex}(,${identifierRegex})*\\)$)*.

The equivalence classes are

| Identifier                      | Openning Parenthesis            | First Inner Identifier        | Comma                           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Correct / Incorrect / Missing   | ( / Another symbol / Missing    | Correct / Incorrect / Missing | , / Another symbol / Missing    |

| Another Identifier              | Closing Parenthesis             |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Correct / Incorrect / Missing   | ( / Another symbol / Missing    |.
